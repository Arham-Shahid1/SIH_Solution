# Automated High-Current Short-Circuit Test System for MCBs  

## ðŸš€ Project Overview  
This project is developed for the **Smart India Hackathon (SIH)** under the problem statement **SIH25054: Smart Automation**.  
It focuses on building an **automated, safe, and precise short-circuit testing system** for Miniature Circuit Breakers (MCBs) in compliance with **IEC 60898-1:2015**.  

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Statement  
Existing MCB testing is manual or semi-automated, leading to:  
- Imprecise R (resistive) and XL (inductive) circuit configurations  
- Longer test times  
- High safety risks for personnel (up to 10,000A fault currents)  
- Reduced accuracy and repeatability  

## ðŸ’¡ Proposed Solution  
An **automated test machine** with:  
- High-Current Transformer (up to 10,000A)  
- Automated R & XL Switching Banks for precise power factor control  
- PLC/Industrial PC with HMI for control and data acquisition  
- High-speed DAQ system for waveform capture and analysis  
- Universal MCB test fixture with arc-proof enclosure and interlocks  
- Automatic test reporting and compliance validation  

## ðŸŽ¯ Relevance to Problem Statement  
- Fully automated, reduces human intervention â†’ **improved safety**  
- Precise control over test parameters â†’ **higher accuracy & repeatability**  
- Faster execution â†’ **reduced testing time & cost**  

## âœ¨ Uniqueness of Solution  
- Combines **real-time automation + safety systems**  
- Uses **modular R/XL switching** for flexible test setups  
- Provides **digital waveform analysis & auto-reports** for certification  

## ðŸ”§ Technology Stack  
- **Hardware**: High-current transformer, R/XL switching banks, Rogowski coil, universal MCB fixture, safety interlocks  
- **Control & Automation**: PLC / Industrial PC, HMI, emergency shutdown system  
- **Data Acquisition**: High-speed DAQ cards, sensors, oscilloscope modules  
- **Software**: LabVIEW / MATLAB / SCADA for data logging & visualization  

## ðŸ“Š Impact & Benefits
